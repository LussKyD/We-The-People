            <h2>The Journey: Why the 2010 Constitution?</h2>
            <p>The 2010 Constitution is not just a document; it's a social contract born from a long struggle for justice, especially following years of **centralized presidential power** and the divisive **2007 post-election violence**. Kenyans demanded a system that would safeguard rights and ensure power was shared.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Contentious Issues in the 2010 Referendum:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Land Reform:</strong> Opposition came from large landowners who feared the reforms would challenge their holdings and address historical injustices.</li>
                <li><strong>Abortion Clause:</strong> Highly debated by religious groups who opposed the clause permitting abortion in cases of 'maternal health'.</li>
                <li><strong>Kadhi Courts:</strong> The inclusion of these courts (which settle Muslim civil matters) was controversial, raising questions about the secular nature of the state.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Despite these debates, the Constitution passed with **67% approval** and was promulgated on **27 August 2010** .</p>
        </section>

        <section id="intro">
            <h2>Preamble and Scope</h2>
            <p>The preamble sets the tone by emphasizing national unity, sovereignty, respect for the rule of law, human dignity, equality, social justice, and the aspirations of all Kenyans for a better future.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="rights">
            <h2>Bill of Rights (Chapter Four)</h2>
            <p>A cornerstone of the constitution, it guarantees civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights to all citizens. It includes rights to **equality, freedom of expression, fair trial, education, healthcare, labor rights, environmental protection**, and specifically protects marginalized groups including women, children, and persons with disabilities.</p>
        </section>

            <p>A **bicameral Parliament** is introduced composed of the **National Assembly** (primary law-making) and the **Senate** (protecting county interests). The legislature makes laws, oversees the executive, and represents the people.</p>

            <h3>The Judiciary</h3>
            <p>Establishes an **independent judiciary** with a Supreme Court, High Court, and subordinate courts. It guarantees judicial independence, access to justice, and interprets the law to ensure constitutional compliance.</p>

        <section id="devolution">
            <h2>Devolution (Counties)</h2>
            <p>One of the constitution’s key features, it creates **47 counties** with elected governors and assemblies. Counties manage local affairs including health services, agriculture, and infrastructure, **bringing governance closer to the people** and distributing resources more equitably (See **Fourth Schedule**).</p>
        </section>

        <section id="land">
            <h2>Land and Environment</h2>
            <p>Land is classified into **public, private, and community land** with clear regulations. The constitution guarantees environmental rights and outlines sustainable management of natural resources, aiming to resolve historical land disputes.</p>

        <section id="finance">
            <h2>Finance, Security, and Elections</h2>

            <h3>Elections and Political Parties</h3>
            <p>Regulates **free and fair elections**, the conduct of political parties, and voter rights. It outlines the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC)’s role.</p>

        </section>

        <section id="conclusion">
