            <h2>Article 1: Who's the Boss?</h2>
            <p><strong>Simplified Summary:</strong> All power belongs to the people of Kenya. **You are the ultimate boss!** You can give this power to your leaders (like the President, MP, or MCA) to use for you, but they must always use it according to the Constitution.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 2: Kenya's Identity (The Rules We Live By)</h2>
            <p><strong>Simplified Summary:</strong> This chapter defines what makes Kenya *Kenya*. It establishes the **National Values** (like patriotism, human dignity, and rule of law) that **every single person and leader** in the country must follow. It also defines our official symbols like the flag, the National Anthem, and the Coat of Arms—these are things we all share!</p>

            <h2>Chapter 4: The Bill of Rights (Your Superpowers!)</h2>
            <p><strong>Simplified Summary:</strong> This is the most powerful part of the Constitution! It's a list of fundamental rights and freedoms that belong to **you**—your guaranteed "superpowers" that the government and nobody else can take away. It covers everything from the right to life and equality, to education and privacy. **Knowing this chapter is knowing your full legal strength!**</p>
